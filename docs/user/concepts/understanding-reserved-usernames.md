# Introduction

Protecting Mailchain users is a priority for us. The decision to reserve usernames was taken to increase security and increase the chance in a fair way for community members to create an account with their preferred username. Mailchain usernames are non-transferable. They cannot be sold or traded so there is no benefit for someone to seize a collection of usernames for them to go unused.

Mailchain reserved usernames for:

-   Names under 5 characters (see below for [how to request a name](#how-can-i-request-a-reserved-username))
-   Known web3 projects (see below for [how to request a name](#how-can-i-request-a-reserved-username))
-   Administrative and support keywords

:::caution

Usernames in Mailchain are non-transferable. Once a username has been taken, it cannot be reused.

DO NOT buy or accept a username from anyone. Once you create a Secret Recovery Phrase for an account, it cannot be changed. The original owner will always know the Secret Recovery Phrase associated with that Mailchain identity and can access its account data.

## How can I tell if a username is reserved?

1. Go to https://app.mailchain.com/register
2. Type the username into the 'Username' field
3. If the username is reserved, the field will turn red and display the text:

    > This username is reserved, contact support@mailchain if you want to claim it.

4. Alternatively, if the username is taken, the text will read:

    > This username is taken. Try another.

    Or, if the username is unavailable for security reasons (e.g. admin@) the text will read:

    > This username is unavailable. Try another.

## How can I request a reserved username?

If you would like to claim a reserved username, please [raise a support request](/getting-help) with details of the name you would like to register. If you represent a web3 project please provide details or justification.
