# How To Read Mailchain Messages

1. Log into your Mailchain account (or follow this guide to [create an account](./create-a-mailchain-account)).

1. If you have not yet [connected a wallet address](/user/concepts/understanding-connecting-wallets), click 'Inbox' to view your messages.

    If you have registered wallet addresses, you can view all your messages in 'All Inboxes'. To view the messages sent to a specific address select the corresponding inbox.

Each inbox displays the number of unread messages. When you select the inbox, any unread messages will have a blue dot next to them.

You can mark messages as read or unread, or carry out other actions including _star_ to mark as important or _archive_ to remove them from view.
