You have successfully registered your wallet address with a set of messaging keys that belong to your Mailchain account. You no longer need to have wallet connected to send and receive messages, so Mailchain disconnects it.

1.  You now have the option to 'Go To Inbox' or to 'Register Another Address'.

    <img
    	className="guides-image"
    	alt="choose Go To Inbox or Register Another Address"
    	src="/img/user/guides/getting-started/img-register-a-wallet/happy-messaging-near.png"
    />

    You will see your new sub-inbox in the left sidebar.

    <NameServiceSubinboxImage imageShow={props.imageShow} imagePath={props.imagePath} />
