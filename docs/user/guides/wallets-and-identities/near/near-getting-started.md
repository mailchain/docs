Send and receive web3 email with your .near account ID. It’s simple to get started…

# Introduction

The NEAR protocol serves as a secure, scalable foundation for a new kind of decentralized application (dApps). It is also built to be especially easy for developers to use (e.g. by coding in JavaScript). Hundreds of projects are already building exciting dApps on NEAR. It is designed to be simple, with a flexible account model and human readable accounts — any name a user wants instead of a string of letters and numbers.

Near is building up the Blockchain Operating System Web3 stack to integrate experiences from across the open web and streamline the discovery and onboarding experience for users and developers alike. -- _source [https://near.org/blog/near-announces-the-blockchain-operating-system/](https://near.org/blog/near-announces-the-blockchain-operating-system/)_
