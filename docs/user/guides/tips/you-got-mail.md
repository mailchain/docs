Mailchain is a web3 email platform that enables communication between web3 identities. The unified inbox gives you easy access all of your web3 communication for multiple identities (including wallet address, ENS names, Lens profiles, Unstoppable Domains, etc.).

If you have mail waiting for you, it's because someone sent it in the hope that you would read it. So, let's get to it!

To retrieve your messages, you'll need to do the following:

1. Create your Mailchain account (more instructions <a href="../../getting-started/create-a-mailchain-account" target="_blank">here</a>).
2. Register your wallet address with Mailchain (more instructions <a href="../../getting-started/register-a-wallet" target="_blank">here</a>).
3. Make sure the checkbox is checked when you verify your address to retrieve existing messages:

    <img className="guides-image"
     	alt="retrieve messages checkbox"
         src="/img/user/guides/tips/retrieve-web3-messages-checkbox.png"
         max-width="600px"
     />

Once you've completed these steps, you'll be able to see your messages in your Mailchain Inbox.
