# Introduction

Aurora is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based on the layer 1 proof-of-stake blockchain NEAR Protocol. Aurora provides a solution for developers to deploy their apps on an Ethereum-compatible platform, with low transaction costs for their users.

You can register .aurora NFT names at [Freename.io](http://Freename.io), then ‘_mint’ them on the Aurora blockchain. These domains give people full ownership and control of their digital identity, with no renewal fees._

7. A 'Signature Request' will appear in your wallet. It contains the following text:

    ```
    Message:
    Welcome to Mailchain!

    Please sign to start using this address with Mailchain. This will not trigger a blockchain transaction or cost any gas fees.

    What's happening?
    A messaging key will be registered with this address and used only for messaging. It will replace any existing registered messaging keys.

    Technical Details:
    Address: `your_address`
    Messaging key: `a_generated_messaging_key`
    Nonce: `a_number`

    ```

9. The next step checks for connected name services, including .aurora names. This example found `epistola.aurora`. If you do not see your name here, you can manually search for it using the search box. If it still cannot be found, please see [Aurora FAQs](/user/guides/name-services/aurora/aurora-faqs)).
